ATP2C1 gene codes for the secretory pathway Ca2+/Mn2+-ATPase pump type 1 (SPCA1) localizing at the golgi apparatus. Mutations on the human ATP2C1 gene, causing decreased levels of the SPCA1 expression, have been identified as the cause of the Haileyâ€“Hailey disease, a rare skin disorder.

### Our Plan 

1. Use **BMA** to model how Hailey Hailey disease may disrupt the **signalling pathways** within skin cells. Can we characterise skin cell proliferation, differentiation and assymetric division?
2. Modelling Skin cell growth in the basal layer as a **stochastic process**, simulated via the **Gillespie algorithm**.
3. Using **PDEs** to model Healthy Cell Density in epidermal tissue - Can we reconstruct the same patterning based on our understanding of the disease?
