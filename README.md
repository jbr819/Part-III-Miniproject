ATP2C1 gene codes for the secretory pathway Ca2+/Mn2+-ATPase pump type 1 (SPCA1) localizing at the golgi apparatus. Mutations on the human ATP2C1 gene, causing decreased levels of the SPCA1 expression, have been identified as the cause of the Haileyâ€“Hailey disease, a rare skin disorder.

### Outline 

1. We have constructed a executable model implemented using **BMA** to model how Hailey Hailey disease may disrupt the calcium **signalling pathways** within Keratinocytes.
2. We have modelled skin cell population homeostatis in the epidermis as a **stochastic process**, simulated via the **Gillespie algorithm**.
3. We have used **PDEs** to model Keratinocyte density in the epidermis.
