# Part-III-Miniproject
This is a repository for Finley, Izzy and Jack's Part III Miniproject

### Our Plan 

1. Use **Smoldyn** to model **calcium ion** diffusion and active transport in the cell.
2. Use **BMA** to model how Hailey Hailey disease may disrupt the **signalling pathways** within skin cells. Can we characterise skin cell proliferation, differentiation and assymetric division.
3. Modelling Skin cell growth as a **stochastic process**, simulated via the **Gillespie algorithm**.
4. Using **PDEs** to model Healthy Cell Density in Epidermal tissue - Can we reconstruct the same patterning based on our understanding of the disease?
