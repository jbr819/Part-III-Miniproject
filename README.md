# Part-III-Miniproject
This is a repository for Finley, Izzy and Jack's Part III Miniproject

### Our Plan 

1. Use Smoldyn to model calcium ion diffusion and active transport in the cell.
2. Use BMA to model the signalling pathways involed disrupted by Hailey Hailey disease. Can we characterise skin cell proliferation, differentiation and assymetric division.
3. Modelling Skin cell growth as a stochastic process.
4. Using PDEs to model Healthy Cell Density in Epidermal tissue - Can we reconstruct the same patterning based on our understanding of the disease?
